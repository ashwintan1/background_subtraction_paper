## AMATH 515 Final Project

This is a project for investigating and comparing the use of two different background subtraction methods: *Mixture of Gaussians background subtraction* and *RPCA-based background subtraction*. Specifically, for the latter, we will use the Templates for First-Order Conic Solvers method developed by Becker, Candes, and Grant. The final project report can be found [here](https://github.com/ashwintan1/background_subtraction_paper/blob/master/paper/AMATH_515_final_paper_nathaniel_ashwin.pdf)
